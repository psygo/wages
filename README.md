# Predicting Wages with Neural Networks

The main file of this repo is the `Wages.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. In it, you will find:

- A Keras Neural Network Model
- A Linear Regression Model using Scikit-Learn
- Various Data and Model Plots

The other files are:

- `hourly_wages.csv` which holds all the data.
- `map_model.py` which tries to find the best values for the number of units in the Neural Network.
- `wages.py` which holds the models and the plots that are in the Jupyter Notebook.
